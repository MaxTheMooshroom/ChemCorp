ChemCorp
-----------------------

This Factorio mod provides a unique way for players to experiment with chemical reactions and create their own recipes. Spend chemical science packs to explore molecular structures and experiment with different combinations of elements to create new materials. Develop your chemical design skills and learn about real-world chemistry in a gamified way.

### TODO:
- [ ] Analyze vanilla progression and chart recipe flow
- [ ] Research possible real-world replacements for various in-game items:
  - [X] sulphuric-acid
    -  sulphuric-acid
  - [X] plastic-bar
    - polyethylene
    - polypropylene
    - polyvinyl chloride
    - polystyrene
    - polyethylene terephthalate
    - polycarbonate
    - acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
    - polyamide
    - polyurethane
    - polymethyl methacrylate
  - [X] explosives
    - trinitrotoluene
  - [X] cliff-explosives
    - trinitrotoluene
  - [X] uranium-235
    - uranium-235
  - [X] uranium-238
    - uranium-238
  - [X] light-oil
    - NONE ; Real oil does not have a clean distinction between heavy and light ; replace with just "filtered oil"
  - [X] heavy-oil
    - NONE ; Real oil does not have a clean distinction between heavy and light ; replace with just "filtered oil"
  - [ ] petroleum-gas
    - ...
  - [ ] lubricant
    - ...
  - [ ] solid-fuel
    - ...
  - [ ] rocket-fuel
    - hydrazine
    - ...
  - [X] crude-oil
    - vanilla crude oil doesn't have true impurities, they are hand-waved away with "processing". The mod will replace this with actual purification.
    - crude oil
  - [X] Stone
    - Carbonate Rocks
- [ ] Introduce new primary resources from which to extract various secondary, pure resources:
  - [ ] Carbonate Rocks
    - Limestone
    - Dolomite
    - Marble
    - Calcite
  - [ ] Silicate Rocks
    - Silicon
    - Silica
    - Aluminum
    - Potassium
  - [ ] Oil Sludge
    - Sulfur
    - Nitrogen
    - Oxygen
    - Nickel
    - vanadium
    - iron
    - copper

How It Works
-----------------------

This is a tentative design that may change as more progress is made.

Installing the mod immediately provides you with a Chemical Research GUI

Researching the chemical science pack will unlock the following:
- chemical research center
